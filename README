Building and running the driver
*******************************
To build the driver, type "make" to the shell.

To run the driver on a tiny test trace:

	unix> mdriver -V -f short1-bal.rep

The -V option prints out helpful tracing and summary information.

To get a list of the driver flags:

	unix> mdriver -h
